Rules + randomly sampled positive example 1 + ground truth (GT) for example 1 + randomly sampled negative example 2 (randomly decides if positive or negative appears first) + ground truth for example 2 + test example (only for dataset 1 and for example under the same rule). model was be trained on GT1 and GT2. At the same time, we can record prediction for test example along the way.
